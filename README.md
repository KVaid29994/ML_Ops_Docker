🚀 Basic Docker Implementation This repository demonstrates a simple, beginner-friendly Docker setup for containerizing a Python application.


🐳 What is Docker? 

Docker is a platform that helps you:
📦 Package your application with all its dependencies
🚛 Ship it anywhere without worrying about environment issues
🔁 Run it the same way on every machine


🔑 Key Concepts:
Image 🖼️: A snapshot of your app and environment
Container 📦: A running instance of an image
Dockerfile 📝: Instructions to build an image
Docker Hub ☁️: A cloud registry to store and share images

✅ Why Use Docker?
🔒 Consistent environments
⚡ Quick deployments
🧪 Easy testing and CI/CD integration
👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Team collaboration with fewer "it works on my machine" issues

This repository provides a minimal, production-aware setup for containerizing a basic Python application using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. It’s intended as a practical starting point for developers new to Docker or setting up local containerized development environments.
